    "reasoning": "This Firestore structure is designed to manage vehicle bookings for a transportation company. It prioritizes authorization independence and simplifies security rules.  The structure includes collections for `vehicles`, and `customers`, as well as a subcollection for `bookings` under each customer. \n\nAuthorization Independence: Authorization Independence is achieved by storing bookings under the customer document and requiring the `customerId` inside of the booking document. This allows us to confirm the current authenticated user owns the booking. This structure eliminates the need for `get()` calls in security rules.\n\nQAPs Support: QAPs is achieved by storing each booking document under the `customers/{customerId}/bookings/{bookingId}` path, allowing only authenticated users to list booking documents under their path. The structure implements path-based ownership for customer data and their respective bookings."
